%%% Extends the generic server and implements the behavior of a mobile phone.
%%%
%%% The mobile phone provides a number of API functions, allowing it to interact
%%% with the switch (switch.erl) process. In doing so, these functions
%%% manipulate the internal state of the mobile phone directly, and the internal
%%% state of the switch indirectly (see switch.erl).
%%%
%%% SMS messages are simply implemented using the standard messages sending
%%% functionality provided by Erlang (i.e. using !).
%%%
%%% The state of the mobile phone process, maintained as a pair, consists of the
%%% mobile phone number (called the MSISDN) and the flight mode status.
%%%
%%% The flight mode status can be one of two values:
%%% fmode() = flight_mode_on | flight_mode_off where:
%%%   * flight_mode_on means that the mobile phone is currently detached from
%%%     the mobile network and cannot receive any messages.
%%%   * flight_mode_off means that the mobile phone is currently attached to the
%%%     mobile network and can receive messages.
%%% A mobile phone process that starts should immediately attach itself to the
%%% mobile network, enabling it to receive text messages. Any pending messages
%%% that were sent when the mobile was not attached to the network should be
%%% processed at this time by the mobile phone (e.g. printing them to screen).
%%% Terminating mobile processes should (in their cleanup function) detached
%%% from the mobile network to inform the switch.
%%%
%%% The structure of the internal mobile phone state tuple is structured as
%%% follows:
%%% mob() = {Msisdn::string(), FlightMode::fmode()} where:
%%%   * Msisdn::string() is the number the mobile phone process is subscribed
%%%     with.
%%%   * FlightMode::fmode() is the current flight mode status.
%%% The MSISDN to be used by the mobile phone is set at startup, whereas the
%%% initial value of FlightMode is set to flight_mode_off, to denote the fact
%%% that the mobile phone is immediately attached to the mobile network.

%% Performs cleanup before the mobile phone process is terminated by detaching
%% the internally managed Msisdn from the mobile network.

%%          therefore, the Msisdn could then not be detached because it does
%%          not exist anymore). The atom warning indicates that despite failing
%%          to detach the internally managed Msisdn from the mobile network,
%%          both the switch and mobile will remain in a consistent state:
%%          Msisdn was already removed from the switch, and the mobile phone
%%          process will in any case terminate (since we are already in the
%%          cleanup phase). When next switched on, the mobile phone will behave
%%          normally (i.e. either return an error because it is not subscribed,
%%          or attach successfully if it has been resubscribed).
